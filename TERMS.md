***<a name="Copyright">Copyright</a>*** 

***<a name="Copyleft">Copyleft</a>*** is a legal construct to grant
   freedoms, as defined in [Free Software](#Free_Software), and
   requiring all derivative work to preserve the same
   freedoms. Copyleft is usually divided in to [Weak
   Copyleft](#Weak_Copyleft) and [Strong
   Copyleft](#Strong_Copyleft). Copyleft is implemented using a [Free
   Software](#Free_Software) [Licenses](#License), e.g. the
   [GPL](#GPL) family. See also [Copyright](#Copyright)

***<a name="Weak_Copyleft">Weak_Copyleft</a>*** is a variant of
   [Copyleft](#Copyleft) allowing a software to link against a weakly
   copylefted work, typically a library, without requiring the
   software itself to be distributed under a Weak Copyleft
   license. However the library would remain under the initial Weak
   Copyleft license. See also [Copyright](#Copyright),
   [Copyleft](#Copyleft) amd [Strong Copyleft](#Strong_Copyleft).
